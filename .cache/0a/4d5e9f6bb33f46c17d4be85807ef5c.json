The gardens feature a variety of trees, plants, and flowers, including cherry blossoms in the spring and vibrant red and orange leaves in the autumn. There are also several smaller temples and shrines on the grounds, as well as a teahouse where visitors can enjoy a traditional Japanese tea ceremony.</p>\r\n            <p class=\"detallp\">Kinkaku-ji is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Kyoto and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
