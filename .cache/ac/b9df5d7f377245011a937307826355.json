It has a long and fascinating history that spans over a millennium. In 794, Kyoto (then known as Heian-kyo) was established as the capital of Japan under the rule of Emperor Kanmu. The city was designed to reflect Chinese and Japanese cultural influences, with a grid-like layout and numerous temples and shrines.</p>\r\n            <figure>\r\n                <div class=\"video-fluid\">\r\n                    <iframe class=\"video-fluid-item\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D9ZX2HvmHmk\" title=\"All you need to know about KYOTO\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <figcaption class=\"figcaptionvideo\">Japanese Journey 2020</figcaption>\r\n            </figure>\r\n            <p class=\"detallp\">During the Heian period (794-1185), Kyoto became the center of Japanese culture and politics. The aristocracy developed a refined and sophisticated culture, which included the creation of Japanese literature, calligraphy, and music. However, in the 12th century, Kyoto was plagued by civil wars between powerful samurai clans, resulting in the city being burned down several times, including by the famous warlord Oda Nobunaga in the late 16th century.</p>    \r\n            <p class=\"detallp\">Kyoto experienced a revival in the Edo period (1603-1868) when the Tokugawa shogunate established its capital in Edo (modern-day Tokyo) and Kyoto became the cultural and artistic center of Japan. Many of Kyoto's most famous landmarks, such as Kiyomizu-dera temple and Nijo Castle, were built during this time.</p>\r\n            <p class=\"detallp\">In 1868, the Meiji Restoration ended the shogunate and moved the capital to Tokyo, but Kyoto remained an important cultural center. Many traditional crafts, such as pottery and textiles, are still produced in Kyoto today.</p>\r\n            <p class=\"detallp\">During World War II, Kyoto was spared from bombing due to its cultural and historical significance. However, the city was heavily damaged by a large earthquake in 1995, which destroyed many buildings and claimed thousands of lives.</p>\r\n            <p class=\"detallp\">Today, Kyoto is a bustling modern city that also preserves its rich cultural heritage. It is a popular tourist destination and home to many universities and research institutes.</p>\r\n            <p class=\"detallp\">Want to know how to write Kyoto in Japanese?</p>\r\n            <button onclick=\"funcioclic()\">Yes</button>\r\n            <p class=\"detallp\" id=\"kyotokanji\"></p>\r\n        </div>    \r\n    </main>\r\n    <footer>\r\n        <p>2023 Â© Kyoto Travel</p>\r\n        <p>Activitat realitzada per Aina Sorribas</p>\r\n    </footer>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"37d5c91bd0a7485455ec05be7711424b","cacheData":{}}
